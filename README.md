# IgorProFunctions
A family of Igor Pro functions I use for analyzing series of electrophysiology recordings imported using the PPT utility. Tested under Igor Pro version 6.3.7.2.

As noted in the code, these procedures were designed to be used on data acquired with Patchmaster, imported with PPT, and having a particular characteristic structure. I include them here in case anyone finds them useful, but they may or may not work out of the box on your data. Please be cautious when applying them to your datasets, and let me know if you have any questions.
